## Background

* This was my first assignment in Data Science with Python class. Instructions of the assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/bharatimalik/Data-Science-Analysis-with-Python/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis/HW1%20--%20%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20on%20twitter%20tweets.pdf) 
* One of the trending topic was chosen on Twitter to perform sentiment analysis. 
* For the purpose of this analysis, I collected 1472 tweets. 
* Based on the agreeement with Twitter to only read the tweets and do analysis for academic project, I won't be sharing the trending topic nor the content of the tweets.

## Approach
* The sentiment analysis was performed on a "word" level
* You can go [here](https://github.com/bharatimalik/Data-Science-Analysis-with-Python/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis/Sentiment%20Analysis%20on%20chosen%20trending%20topic%20on%20twitter.ipynb) to access the code

## References
